# Discordex
# This is a test app to learn more about Elixir; it's not a production app.

# What I want to learn by doing this?

- Writing for my blog to improve my English skills. ðŸ˜„
- Writing Elixir code and Erlang: I want to become more familiar with the Elixir approach, and yes, this is it.
- Consuming and distributing "Complete apps": I want to understand how apps with large-scale can be distributed, including scalability, observability, and deployment. Being a big Discord user, I decided to use Discord.

All the things I'm learning here will be documented on [my blog](https://astahjmo.github.io). Please check out all my posts!


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `discordex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:discordex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/discordex>.
